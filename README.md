ec2-instance-operation
======================
You can stop and start your Ec2 instance if it has an Amazon EBS volume as root device. By Stopping the instance, Amazon shut it down and they donâ€™t charge for that stopped instance or data transfer fees. howevere they charge for the storage of EBS volumes.
After stopping the instance you can change the instance type, so it saves lot of time in upgrade.
